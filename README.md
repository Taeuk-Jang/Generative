# Generative
Generative models for fair disentanglement.

## Information about the source code:
util.py : tnse visualization and save utils.
module.py : contain models for each data domains.
train_baseline.py : Training script for baseline VAE model.

train_fair-3.py : This is on-progress script for HQ images.

There are three experiments demonstrated in each notebook files.

## To download datasets:
* Tabular dataset : https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360
Extract aif360 folder and paste into this repo.


## Pre-trained models:
* MNIST-USPS : 
* CelebA : 

## Prerequisites
